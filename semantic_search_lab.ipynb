This view holds that international borders are becoming so porous that they no longer fulfill their role as barriers to the movement of goods, ideas, people, and as markers of the extent power of the state. Yet, border build-ups and massive deportations suggest that they are all the more relevant and that the state's power has not diminished. Other social processes like the policing of black and brown bodies, the nativist political rhetoric that stigmatizes Latin migrants and privileges some refugees over others suggests that borders remain relevant at social levels, beyond the nation-state. This class provides a solid overview of the study of borders and boundaries from within anthropology and beyond. Important questions we will consider include: What are borders and borderlands? How have they been created? Do borders produce a particular kind of culture? How are borders artifiacts of history and geography? How do borders change over time and what impact does change have on the lives of people? How are border people imagined, constructed, and exploited by individuals, governments, and corporations on both sides of the border? How do citizens of the borderlands themselves resist injustice and violence? In exploring these questions, we will consider various analytical and interdisciplinary approaches.\"},\n",

We also will debate the methodological potential of oral history as a tool for social transformation and empowerment (of both the interviewer and interviewee). The second half of the course focuses more narrowly on the practice of oral histories; i.e. obtaining Institutional Review Board Human Subject Review approval, constructing an oral history interview protocol, conducting history interviews, transcription practices and techniques, and the production of web-based oral histories. Ideally you should choose a community leader, an elder, or an immigrant living in Des Moines.

Transracial adoption, and adoption more generally, are typically represented in U.S. media through romantic, mythical narratives that celebrate the formation of “color-blind” “forever families.” While we will certainly consider the perspectives of people who appreciate and advocate such views, we will be actively complicating such perspectives by considering the elements often left out of public narratives. We will be exploring transracial adoption as a contemporary social issue that fundamentally requires a critical perspective in order to understand the ways it is shaped by a broad range of social interests and power relations in the United States and abroad.

We ask questions about what violence is, how violence is produced and reproduced, what makes violence \"\"political,\"\" and what is its scope. We respond to these questions by looking at some of the main theoretical conceptualizations of violence (Hobbes, Hegel, Marx, Fanon, Arendt, and Bourdieu, among others) and by exploring case studies from across the globe. The course examines various forms of violence (extraordinary, discreet, structural, everyday, symbolic), their effects upon social structure and life-worlds, as well as how indviduals and communities have responded and reworked their experience of violence.'},\n",

       "  'description': 'This course is an introduction to the key concepts, theories, and methods of medical anthropology. Medical anthropology examines affliction and healing in a cross-cultural perspective. It emphasizes the understanding of how health and healing are shaped by both cultural and biological processes. It also analyzes the relations among health, illness, social institutions, power, and cultural representations. Medical anthropologists examine the ways in which global processes--health policies, epidemics, war and violence, inequalities--affect the life of individuals and communities. They take us into refugee camps, hospitals, zones of social abandonment, factories, and strees across the world and in our community. This course will focus on three broad topics. We will start by discussing how health-related issues, including disease and treatment, are far more than narrow biological phenomenon. By examining specific ethnographic cases, we will see how these processes are all heavily influenced by cultural and social factors as well. We will then grapple with the Foucauldian concept of \"\"biopower\"\" by means of specific ethnographic applications. By reading about colonial and postcolonial governance in the global South, the \"\"construction\"\" of mental illness, current national and global policies toward asylums seekers, and the use of pharmaceuticals, we will reflect upon the ways in which medicine can be an instrument of domination, discipline, and surveillance. The final section of the course discusses the contributions that medical anthropology can make to increase access to health services and to improve--i.e., humanize--health care in the U.S. and across the world.'},\n",

A few examples of the ways in which learning analytics is used in the fields of education and organizational learning include measuring key indicators of student/learner performance, supporting student/learner development, understanding and improving the effectiveness of teaching/training practices, and informing institutional decisions and strategy. These same strategies can be applied across disciplines in contexts where there is a focus on employee and stakeholder learning. In this course, students will examine the theories, concepts, and practices of learning analytics. The four overarching methodologies of learning analytics will be explored; specifically, descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. Prominent learning analytics tools will be reviewed. We will also discuss key ethical, practical, and cultural challenges to the effective and appropriate use of learning analytics'},\n",

In order to improve performance, it is necessary for leaders to understand and consider the benefits in deploying a systemic/systematic approach to continual improvement.  Effective leaders carry out their roles from systems perspectives; viewing organizations as complex and dynamic in nature, with its people, equipment, and processes working together to achieve the system’s aim. However, systems thinking is not enough, for ultimately we seek ever-improving results.  Leaders must be able to operationalize a systems perspective through effective strategic planning.

Approximately 1,000 immigrant children enter schools each day.  While immigration is not reserved for urban contexts, the Current Population Report (Lollock, 2001), found that almost half of the foreign born lived in a central part of a city in metropolitan areas (45%), compared with slightly more than one quarter of the native population (27.5%). For many immigrant children and families, schools are the first American institution they must negotiate.  In this course, we will review research that centers immigrant children - in hopes of learning from them how they experience schools.  We will discuss challenges that students face including dislocation, cultural disorientation, language learning, and racism. In addition, we will analyze the issue of immigration in the larger context of globalization.

Using ideas from the interdisciplinary fields of urban studies and community planning, students will investigate how processes of political advocacy, decision making, and sustainable design are occurring in cities, suburbs, and towns. The course also includes a community-engaged learning component that will bring students into dialogue with planners and residents in the city of Des Moines.'},\n",

Students learn to identify issues at all phases of a GIS project and work with the client and fellow team members to creatively solve problems. Client and consultant relationships are established by working with Central Iowa agencies and organizations. Students are exposed to internship opportunities and are able to network with professionals in a variety of fields.'},\n",

       "  'description': 'Dynamic models are critical tools in the analysis of time-dependent systems. Many environmental systems are dynamic in this way: local populations may fluctuate in response to the appearance of a nonnative species; the risk associated with a pulse of pollutants may depend upon how quickly downstream mixing can occur; and the adaptation ability of species might be a function of the rate of change in ecological conditions. In this course, we will construct dynamic models, learn how to parameterize them even in the face of imperfect data, and discuss generalized patterns exhibited by complex environmental systems, such as overshoot, resilience, oscillations, and chaos. Prereq: any college-level mathematics or statistics course.'},\n",
