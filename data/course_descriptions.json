        "description": "According to some scholars, we are living in a world where state borders are increasingly obsolete. This view holds that international borders are becoming so porous that they no longer fulfill their role as barriers to the movement of goods, ideas, people, and as markers of the extent power of the state. Yet, border build-ups and massive deportations suggest that they are all the more relevant and that the state's power has not diminished. Other social processes like the policing of black and brown bodies, the nativist political rhetoric that stigmatizes Latin migrants and privileges some refugees over others suggests that borders remain relevant at social levels, beyond the nation-state. This class provides a solid overview of the study of borders and boundaries from within anthropology and beyond. Important questions we will consider include: What are borders and borderlands? How have they been created? Do borders produce a particular kind of culture? How are borders artifiacts of history and geography? How do borders change over time and what impact does change have on the lives of people? How are border people imagined, constructed, and exploited by individuals, governments, and corporations on both sides of the border? How do citizens of the borderlands themselves resist injustice and violence? In exploring these questions, we will consider various analytical and interdisciplinary approaches."

It illustrates the emergence and implications of feminist perspectives for cultural anthropology by examining the distrinct ways anthropologists have approached the entanglement of gender, culture, and power.  It begins by considering the marginalized history of women as both anthropologists and subjects of anthropological analyses.  Against this background, it devotes attention to specific problems and strategies, including the body, sexuality, the state, kinship relations and economic production.  Throughout,  readings, class discussions and student projects seek not only to work through the awkward relationship between feminism and anthropology, but also to address the varieties of women's experiences and identities cross-culturally.

In the first part of the course, we will engage in readings and discussion of the role of oral history within the field of anthropology, ethical considerations, the importance of informed consent, and theoretical debates regarding the practice and methods of oral histories. We also will debate the methodological potential of oral history as a tool for social transformation and empowerment (of both the interviewer and interviewee). The second half of the course focuses more narrowly on the practice of oral histories; i.e. obtaining Institutional Review Board Human Subject Review approval, constructing an oral history interview protocol, conducting history interviews, transcription practices and techniques, and the production of web-based oral histories. Ideally you should choose a community leader, an elder, or an immigrant living in Des Moines. In the final third of the course, we will work together to transform interviews into written web- based oral histories. We will spend significant time discussing your progress, dilemmas, and strategies as we move through the process. You will be trained in Wordpress in order to complete this part of the assignment. In the final weeks of the course, we will reflect on the experience, focusing on the challenges and rewards of oral history as method.

We will consider this topic through a broad range of disciplinary perspectives, including racial-ethnic studies, sociology, women\u2019s and gender studies, anthropology, history, memoir, and film/video. Transracial adoption, and adoption more generally, are typically represented in U.S. media through romantic, mythical narratives that celebrate the formation of \u201ccolor-blind\u201d \u201cforever families.\u201d While we will certainly consider the perspectives of people who appreciate and advocate such views, we will be actively complicating such perspectives by considering the elements often left out of public narratives. We will be exploring transracial adoption as a contemporary social issue that fundamentally requires a critical perspective in order to understand the ways it is shaped by a broad range of social interests and power relations in the United States and abroad. We will explore the ways a critical perspective on race, gender, reproduction, and power relations reframe public narratives about the transfer of children from poor mothers to middle class and wealthy families."

Medical anthropology examines affliction and healing in a cross-cultural perspective. It emphasizes the understanding of how health and healing are shaped by both cultural and biological processes. It also analyzes the relations among health, illness, social institutions, power, and cultural representations. Medical anthropologists examine the ways in which global processes--health policies, epidemics, war and violence, inequalities--affect the life of individuals and communities. They take us into refugee camps, hospitals, zones of social abandonment, factories, and strees across the world and in our community. This course will focus on three broad topics. We will start by discussing how health-related issues, including disease and treatment, are far more than narrow biological phenomenon. By examining specific ethnographic cases, we will see how these processes are all heavily influenced by cultural and social factors as well. We will then grapple with the Foucauldian concept of \"\"biopower\"\" by means of specific ethnographic applications. By reading about colonial and postcolonial governance in the global South, the \"\"construction\"\" of mental illness, current national and global policies toward asylums seekers, and the use of pharmaceuticals, we will reflect upon the ways in which medicine can be an instrument of domination, discipline, and surveillance. The final section of the course discusses the contributions that medical anthropology can make to increase access to health services and to improve--i.e., humanize--health care in the U.S. and across the world."

This course will address these questions by drawing on readings from history, religious studies, anthropology, sociology, and film studies. We look at some specific cases of societies experiencing turmoil and violence that cannot possibly be understood except in reference to local myths and rituals. We then conclude with a look at mythical and ritual phenomena in American society, focusing on urban myths, vampire legends, and UFO stories to reflect on what these stories tell about \"\"us.\"\""

The course will be reading-intensive and will involve the curation of an exhibition or an alternate engagement with art objects to convey manners of perception. The class is discussion based; students will be required to do reading each week and respond to the text in writing with images of art. Additionally, notes will be required on each reading to have more in-depth discussions. The note-taking will be mandatory. The reading list will change each year, depending on the idea of perception being pursued, but the core list will include: Walter Benjamin, Lewis Carroll, Franz Kafka, Le Zehou, Barbara Stafford, and Tang Hou."

A few examples of the ways in which learning analytics is used in the fields of education and organizational learning include measuring key indicators of student/learner performance, supporting student/learner development, understanding and improving the effectiveness of teaching/training practices, and informing institutional decisions and strategy. These same strategies can be applied across disciplines in contexts where there is a focus on employee and stakeholder learning. In this course, students will examine the theories, concepts, and practices of learning analytics. The four overarching methodologies of learning analytics will be explored; specifically, descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. Prominent learning analytics tools will be reviewed. We will also discuss key ethical, practical, and cultural challenges to the effective and appropriate use of learning analytics"

According to Rong & Brown (2002, one in ten U.S. children was born outside of the United States, and one in five live in a household headed by an immigrant.  Approximately 1,000 immigrant children enter schools each day.  While immigration is not reserved for urban contexts, the Current Population Report (Lollock, 2001), found that almost half of the foreign born lived in a central part of a city in metropolitan areas (45%), compared with slightly more than one quarter of the native population (27.5%) For many immigrant children and families, schools are the first American institution they must negotiate.  In this course, we will review research that centers immigrant children - in hopes of learning from them how they experience schools.  We will discuss challenges that students face including dislocation, cultural disorientation, language learning, and racism. In addition, we will analyze the issue of immigration in the larger context of globalization.  Finally, we will explore opportunities for educating immegrant children in urban contexts - with the possibility of schools as sites for humanization and social transformation."

According to Rong & Brown (2002), one in ten U.S. children was born outside of the United States, and one in five live in a household headed by an immigrant.  Approximately 1,000 immigrant children enter schools each day.  While immigration is not reserved for urban contexts, the Current Population Report (Lollock, 2001), found that almost half of the foreign born lived in a central part of a city in metropolitan areas (45%), compared with slightly more than one quarter of the native population (27.5%). For many immigrant children and families, schools are the first American institution they must negotiate.  In this course, we will review research that centers immigrant children - in hopes of learning from them how they experience schools.  We will discuss challenges that students face including dislocation, cultural disorientation, language learning, and racism. In addition, we will analyze the issue of immigration in the larger context of globalization. Finally, we will explore opportunities for educating immigrant children in urgan contexts - with the possibility of schools as sites for humanization and social transformation."

In addition to developing skills needed for classroom and capstone presentations, Public Voices addresses issues of equity and ethics when accessing the powers of speech to participate in communal and civic life."

        "description": "This will serve as a foundational course for students seeking to complete the concentration in Global and Comparative Public Health. It will also be of interest to students who simply want to be more informed about a system that affects them daily or who are exploring career or personal service options to work in the developing world.  The course will also serve to familiarize students interested in pursuing a Master of Public Health degree with what they may expect in their graduate studies.  We will explore both the US and foreign public health systems. We will look at: (1) Public Health - its history, what it is and how it may be defined; (2) Epidemiology - how we measure, prevent and treat disease; (3) Social and Cultural Aspects of Health - looking at the causes behind the causes of health and disease.  Unhealthy diets may cause heart disease, but something else usually causes that unhealthy diet; (4) Health Systems - comparing how the health care systems in the US and other countries work; (5) Health in the Developing World - common diseases, foreign aid and aid agencies, health and development, working or volunteering in the developing world.    Students should expect to disagree (politely and professionally of course!) at times with the readings, the instructor and each other.  Problems, their causes and their solutions in public health are complex, rarely obvious, sometimes counter-intuitive and often influenced by politics and competing political ideologies."

In this course, we will explore why countries are poor, what can be done to alleviate their poverty, and some of the results of health and development aid schemes. This is a reading and discussion intensive type course that will familiarize students with current theories, and controversies in health and development. Working in this area is not easy.  Idealists and do-gooders burn out quickly.  Having an awareness of the major issues in development will assist you in being as effective as possible in your volunteer work or career as an aid worker. It will also make you a better informed citizen and voter.

The course pursues one major theme to accomplish these goals - it focuses on how actions Africans have taken have affected the course of the continent's history and sub- Saharan Africa's interaction with the world."

All three were among the first Amerindian cultures to encounter the physical, psychological, technological, strategic, and viral advantages of conquering Europeans in the New World.  The course explores the rise, expansion, and collapse of each civilization and concludes with the systematic imposition of Spanish cultural forms in America.  Does evidence suggest that these once-flourishing kingdoms had irreversibly decayed at the time of European contact?  Or did they contain the seeds of further imperial and capitalist expansion?  What evidence exists of Amerindian cultural resistance and survival in the wake of the brutal Iberian conquest?  What are the historical legacies of the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayas?"

        "description": "Africa's history in the 19th and 20th centuries is crucial not only to understanding Africa's role and relevance in world history but also to understanding current circumstances and challenges that face the continent today. This is the case because, during this period, Africa experienced one of the most disruptive times in the continent's history--the period of European conquest and colonial rule.  European powers endeavoured to 'civilize' Africa--a process intended to transform Africans not only economically and politically but also in terms of how Africans saw themselves and their place in the world.  Thus, in many ways, the continent in 1970 looked quite different than it had a century earlier.  However, despite the differences, European powers clearly failed in their attempts to transform Africa and to 'civilize' its people according to their late 19th century Eurocentric, modernist notions of civilization.  HIST 140 endeavours to analyze why.  The main theme of this course is that, to understand change in Africa's history in this period of time, the colonial period itself should be 'decolonized' and seen as a moment in African history as opposed to a period in European history.  In effect, the colonial state and its transformative goals must not be seen as an all-powerful institution operating hegemonically to achieve its ends uncontested; rather, it needs to be seen as embroiled and imbricated in the warp and weft of African life.  Africa's colonial moment did not see Europeans (whether colonial officials, businessmen, missionaries, settlers, etc.) directing change by fiat; rather, they were subject to the very social, economic, and political forces that had been making Africa's history for generation.  Drawing on recent research into local histories, histories of women and children, domestic politics, production relations, governance structures, etc.  HIST 140 will question the degree to which Africa's colonial moment was African as well as colonial."

Although a clear and precise chronology is critical to understanding Aztec historical development, the course is divided into three overlapping thematic categories of historical analysis that highlight both the vitality and contradictions of the Aztec world: Gender, Relations of Power, and Imperialism. The section on sex examines the various roles and functions that females and males performed from birth to death, investigating the extent to which the Mexica achieved complementarity in relations of gender within an inherently unequal, male- dominated, and militaristic society. The second section on power focuses on kinship, occupational, and tributary relations between the Mexica and other ethnic groups of the Central Valley, early tribal diplomacy and state alliances, the imperial dynasty, and approaches to understanding Aztec territorial expansion. Section three introduces topics related to war: the inculcation of a warrior code of ethics, combat training, military logistics and tactics, politico- religious objectives, battlefield procedure, the disposition of captives, victim management, and human sacrifice. All three categories -- sex, power, and war -- merge under the terrifying, but unifying, force of Aztec religious beliefs. A fatalistic religion and pessimistic worldview promoted the only sense of communal solidarity and purpose in an otherwise violent, rigid, and divided civilization."

First of all, it was not monolithic -- there were large variations across its 70-year history, but there was also regional variation and circumstantial variation within historical periods. Secondly, too many people believe that there was no joy during the Soviet period, but many Soviet citizens lived fairly full lives under the regime. People continued to enjoy a childhood and education, they went to work, got married, and socialized, even if it was within a very different economic, social, cultural and ideological context than in the West."

This course will examine how those changes brought about changes in play. More importantly, this course will use play and material culture as a lens to examine Chinese history and people, especially the people's anxiety, excitement, taboos, and desires, to see how their daily life was shaped by the broader social environment. The temporal and spatial scope of this course will run from the 10th century to present in China, wih a comparative perspective of Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America."

We begin in the mid-nineteenth century because there was a shift in medical knowledge as well as responsibility for health. Although the United States is placed at the center of this course, international context is necessary. A humanities view and historical perspective is essential for understanding the complexity of public health issues-- especially considering that many people who work in the field of public health have science, business, and policy backgrounds. Major themes of the course are: how truth changes over time; how bodies are understood to interact with the environment; how race, class, gender, and sexuality influence aspects of public health; the influence of technologies; the role of government and the locus of responsibility; how environment has been defined over time; urban and industrial issues; and the diversity of change over time--from specific events, people, and discoveries to long-term shifts.

While this tradition has, historically, played a rather minor role in larger conversations, since the mid-twentieth century, thinkers have taken up the question of our moral responsibility to non-humans. These questions have ranged from whether (and which) non-humans might have rights to whether we have a moral responsibility to prevent species from going extinct regardless of the impact of their extinction on anyone or anything. Not only are these questions interesting and important in themselves, but additionally by carefully attending to these conversations we are able to think about ethics and ethical reasoning differently simply by engaging less frequently discussed topics."

This course offers an examination of these and other questions. We will begin with an introduction to several perspectives and terms that will shape our discussion, and then we will proceed with a historical survey of the interaction of science and Christian theology in western culture. Students who successfully complete this course will achieve a greater knowledge of the history of science and Christian theology, sharpened skills for analyzing the methods and practices of both science and Christian theology, and a cultivated awareness of how science and Christian theology continue to interact in contemporary American society to shape public policy and perceptions."

However, rather than decide what \"\"really\"\" caused them or argue about what \"\"really\"\" happened, this course will focus more on the nature of evidence.  When we read a description of \"\"what happened\"\" what constitutes the evidence?  Who gets to decide what is valid and what is not?  How do these ideas of evidence come into play with various strategies of writing from personal narrative to sermon to other forms? How does this increased awareness of the way evidence is \"\"embedded\"\" in social reality affect your views about your own reading, writing, and judging? In addition to thinking and writing about these questions, we will assess similarities and differences between the witch trials and the trail of Anne Hutchinson.  We will do this through a \"\"Reacting to the Past\"\" curriculum which provides selected readings and role playing.  This unit will be about a month of the semester and will give us another \"\"body of evidence,\"\" so to speak.

As practiced, however, the philosophy of religion usually gets narrowly focused on either the rationality of modern-western religion or the religiosity of modern-western philosophy. This course ventures a new approach in the philosophy of religion, one that is religiously diverse and historically grounded. As such, it seeks first to survey several different instances of reason-giving in several different religions of the world. It will then formally compare these instances of reason-giving in an effort to detect important and interesting similarities and differences between them. Finally, it will ask whether and how these instances and patterns can be critically evaluated with respect to their truth and value. Since this is a philosophy of religion course, particular emphasis will be placed on this third and final step: can one inquire into the truth and value of religious reasons and ideas?  If so, how?  If not, why not?

Drawing on recent writing in the \"\"affective turn\"\" in the humanities and social sciences and earlier work on \"\"structures of feeling,\"\" this course considers the rhetorical policing of the boundaries between stability/ instability, acceptance/resistance, and normality/deviance in specific emotional and political states of being and becoming."

This course examines three primary contributions in this regard. Firstly, it delves into the classical and contemporary works of anthropologists who have focused on political structures and cultures that existed outside, preceded, or challenged the paradigm of the \"modern\" state. Secondly, the course explores how anthropologists investigate state power and politics, with a particular emphasis on understanding how the state is perceived, experienced, and manifested in the daily lives of individuals and communities both within the United States and globally. Lastly, we look at the concept of \u201cpower\u201d, critically examining select ethnographic examples that have either applied or challenged classical theories. Through this analysis, we will appreciate how anthropology helps unveil the intricate ways in which power operates, both in invisible and visible ways."

The letters and reminiscences written by those affected by the conflict often blurred the line between reality and fiction, while countless scholars have attempted to understand the war's origins and legacy. The records that they have consulted and stories they tell still resonate today, and thanks to the rapid growth of digital archives, are now accessible to readers the world over.   The course will assess two different categories of historical documents: the first constitutes artistic and traditional scholarly engagements with the Great War (the \"\"Literature Project\"\") and the second encompasses texts or studies focused on archives, digitally curated sites, or broadcasts (the \"\"Archival Project\"\")."

        "description": "The immense growth of slavery and slave trade research in the last quarter century has made examinations of unfree labor a major issue for world research.  Studies of Atlantic slavery have generated the bulk of that research, and as a result have challenged many traditional perceptions of that trade and its associated system of slavery. However, despite the unquestioned value of these recent analyses, most of these studies have looked at Atlantic slavery from the American side of the ocean. Consequently, the African nature of Atlantic slavery has often lacked close scrutiny.      This course has two goals:  1)  to root Atlantic slavery and its trade in its African context, and 2) to help incorporate recent research findings into popular understandings of the Atlantic trade.      The major argument of this course is that one cannot know why the Atlantic trade happened as it did nor how Atlantic slavery developed as it did without understanding the context which produced the people who were sold into slavery.  Therefore, the course looks at the influence political, social, economic, and cultural factors in Africa had on the making of slavery and the slave trade both in Africa and the Americas. In doing so, the course will challenge students to rethink their own notions of Atlantic slavery as they analyze and critique the ideas encountered in this course."

The course balances environments that are both physical (geology, rivers, trees and concrete) and cultural (society, ideas and design).   We will investigate urban environmental history through different times, places and lenses. We seek to use historical context to understand recent social and environmental events like Hurricanes Katrina and Harvey, Midwestern flooding, and municipal water supply crises (Flint and Des Moines). We will include subjects like campus sustainability, environmental inequality, urban agriculture, food justice, urban planning, walkability, and our class will ponder post-industrial challenges and visions. Importantly, we will understand the city through environmental and social lenses and link the two. We'll explore urban environments with texts, guests and field trips. We'll define the city as the environment and an environment.

        "description": "How has Charles Darwin influenced the field of literary study? How has neuroscience affected movie making? What can artists tell us about the scientific advancements of their time? How might these advancements have affected art itself? How has biology affected the social sciences? What can the history of science tell us about the process of scientific discovery? Why were so many famous scientists also philosophers? Why and how has religion had such a strong influence on science? What does science have to say about faith? Why are math and philosophy so strongly connected? When, why, and how did science and the humanities become different fields of studies? The concentration program in the Interdisciplinary Study of the Humanities and Sciences (ISHS) explores how we might address such. This course is the cornerstone in the ISHS curriculum; as such, it familiarizes students with the various ways in which the humanities and sciences interact with, influence, and inform one another. The course begins by raising questions about: (1) the nature/definition of the humanities and the sciences as (sets of) disciplines; (2) the boundaries/distinctions between the various fields within/across disciplinary lines; and (3) the characteristic ways in which knowledge is produced, transmitted, and used within each set of disciplines. The course also offers a survey of various models of interaction between the humanities and sciences, including a sampling of work from fields such as philosophy of science, history of science, sociology of science, literary studies of science, science dramatization, fine arts and science, religious studies and science, science journalism, and cultural studies of science. The course equips students to frame and address particular questions (ethical, social, epistemic, practical) that arise at the intersection of the humanities and the sciences."

Students are required to write answers to many practice essay questions and receive feedback. A practice bar examination under exam conditions is given as a midterm and at the end of the semester. Throughout the course, there are live sessions where we provide additional information related to preparing for the bar exam. **Distance Learning Course"

Such legal protections turn musical compositions, artistic expressions, software, films, logos, compositions of matter, chemical fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, medical treatments, computer chips, celebrity images, food names, and even seeds into commodities with market value. But where does the information that goes into such creative work come from and how do we gain access to it? And who benefits from it? How would anything new and creative come into being unless there were cultural resources available for us to transform?

If the destruction of a naturally occurring ecosystem or artifact would enhance the lives of some humans, how should we think about the question of destroying that ecosystem or artifact? Do non-humans have value independent of the value they have to humans? Which non-humans, if any, have rights and why? Answering these, and other questions related to them, will help us to not only be more thoughtful and intentional about our relationship with the non-human world but also to better understand the grounding of our relationships with other humans (e.g., to figure out which non-humans have moral rights we need to have a better understanding of why any right holder has rights)"

The complexities of understanding how families are both shaped by and shape public culture lead us to an interdisciplinary approach to exploring families in context that includes attention to media, public policy, law, and community engagement. Contemporary concerns over families\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat they look like, who they are, how they are shaped by society, how their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legitimacy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is legislated\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhave become subjects of fierce public debates in recent years. We will explore in particular the avenues through which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the state\u00e2\u20ac\u009d legislates families, public debates emerge in the media, and citizens engage in public actions and dialogues over the meaning and shape of contemporary families. Family has always been a site of shifting and contested meanings. Society has investments in defining and regulating families in particular ways, and families, in turn have their own stakes in how they are seen, recognized, and provided for in the public realm of rights, benefits, and obligations associated with citizenship. Indeed, family will be explored as an arena of public debate about the meaning of citizenship. We will, as a class, consider academic and political debates about the meanings of family, as well as participate in public education and community engagement around contemporary local and national issues concerning the diversity of families."

We will also strive for a better sense of how globalization affects each of us as individuals. In other words, we will think about how the global is local, how each of us is positioned within economic, political and cultural systems with a global reach. How are we being shaped by this globalizing world? How can we in turn contribute to shaping this world? The course format is discussion.

On the one hand, we will consider the historical contexts and cultural significance of Western stereotypes of non-Western people and places, while on the other hand, we will explore the significance of these stereotypes for self-understandings and self-images in the West and beyond. Focusing on intersections of race and power, we will analyze popular conceptions and academic constructions of peoples (includeing African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos) and places (such as Africa, the Orient, and the Pacific). Our discussions of these representations will highlight some of the central metaphors and motifs for interpreting indigenous non-Western, and marginalized cultures (primitivism, nostalgia, exoticism). Representations of cultural difference also tell us important things aobut EuroAmerican culture, thus, we will scrutinize whiteness and its significance as well. In addition to our consideration of dominant images and negative stereotypes, weill will review efforts to reimagine cultural difference. We explore these issues and their implications in a series of interconnected cultural domains, including advertising, art, movies, museums, and scholarship.

Each of these topics on its own provides a rich and controversial political debate over the relationship between individuals, political dialogue, and the larger social structure. When explored alongside each other these political debates make clear the role of the state in legitimizing and reproducing particular forms of family, and the ways that people in different social locations-- or embodying particular social identities-- are situated differently in relation to social power. This course will draw on a broad range of disciplinary perspectives including ethnography, history, sociology, women's studies, and American studies.

Special attention will be paid to the barriers that exist between cultures that may potentially disrupt attempts at fluid intercultural communication, as well as the means to circumvent those barriers. By developing insights into the social, cultural, and historical dimensions of relations among racial, ethnic, and gender groups, you will make progress toward achieving one of the course\u2019s major goal: becoming aware of \u201ccultural relativism\u201d as an ethical guiding principle that results in respecting other cultures more than is the case when ethnocentrism is the guiding principle. Cultural relativism is the practice of examining or considering a culture other than one\u2019s own culture through the lens of that culture prior to evaluating or judging it. We will also consider in some depth the role of the media in creating and diffusing information that affects intercultural communication.
